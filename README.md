# Rework-DataCenter-Website
### Refactoring CSS from Existing Jekyll Site
1. **BEM** - use methodology site wide as much as possible
2. **Hugo** - convert site to HUGO once CSS is refactored
3. **Search** - add capability using maybe "lunr.js or best candidate for Static site"
4. **Netlify** - configure site to use Netlify CMS, etc.
